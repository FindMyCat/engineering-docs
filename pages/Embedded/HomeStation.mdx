# Home-Station Tether


The HomeStation establishes a virtual tether with the tracker device, which, when active, prompts the tracker to enter a state of deep sleep, with only the BLE functions remaining operational.
Meanwhile, the HomeStation takes on the responsibility of transmitting the device's location via WiFi.

This means that the tracker's location remains visible while consuming an extremely low amount of battery power.

### Config Options

#### MQTT gateway settings
1. `CONFIG_MQTT_SAMPLE_TRANSPORT_CLIENT_ID`: Change this to FindMyCat Device ID.
2. `CONFIG_MQTT_SAMPLE_TRANSPORT_BROKER_HOSTNAME`: Change this to your Hostname of Cloud instance (DNS).

#### Wifi Config
1. `CONFIG_WIFI_CREDENTIALS_STATIC_SSID`: SSID of your home wifi.
2. `CONFIG_WIFI_CREDENTIALS_STATIC_PASSWORD`: Password of your home wifi.

All this config would ideally use NFC pairing with the FindMyCat iOS app to auto set up, but we must do this in code config file for now.
