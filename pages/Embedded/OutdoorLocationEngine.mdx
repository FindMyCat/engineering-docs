# Outdoor Location Engine

The OutdoorLocationEngine is based on nRF Connect SDK (Zephyr) and in essence does the following two things:

- Listen and Respond to External Commands
- Report Location to the Cloud

The above two responsibilites are managed by the following sub-systems:

## Concepts
#### UDP Listener
The `UDPListener` listens on port `12345` for Commands and relays them to the Dispatcher.

#### GPIO Wake
We listen on GPIO port 0; Pin 10. GPIO `P0.10` for `PowerUp (0)`/`PowerDown (1)` bit from the IndoorLocationEngine,
this controls the power mode of the NRF-9160. When a PowerDown bit is received, the NRF-9160 puts itself into deep-sleep
and wakes up on PowerUp interrupt.

#### Dispatcher
The role of the `Dispatcher` is to manage the `activation` and `idle` states of the `Responder`.
It comes into play when commands are sent via UDP Listener or GPIO pin, in turn triggering the `Dispatcher` to initiate
a callback to the Responder.

#### Responder
When directed to be in an activated state, the Responder takes charge of coordinating the processes that lead to the establishment of a
connection with the MQTT-SN gateway. It then communicates with the LocationEngine to get a location fix and subsequently initiates periodic
location reports according to the predefined interval.

#### Location Engine
The LocationEngine is reponsible for communicating with the NRF-9160 modem and getting a location fix.
It uses a fallback of Cellular location for when GNSS is unavailable.

## Config Options

Following are the required config options to set before you can flash the firmware onto the Tracker.

- `CONFIG_DEVICE_ID`: Set this to the same as the unique ble ID as scanned by the iOS app.
- `CONFIG_MQTT_SN_GATEWAY_IP`: IPv4 address of Cloud instance.

(optional)
- `CONFIG_LTE_EDRX_REQ_VALUE_LTE_M`: controls how long device sleeps before being reachable for external commands.
- `CONFIG_LOCATION_REFRESH_PERIOD_SECONDS`: Interval for location refreshes in non-lost mode. (60s default)
