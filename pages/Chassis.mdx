# 3D Printing

This project involves some resin 3D printing to print the Tracker Body. Don't worry if you do not own or have access
to a 3D resin printer, there are some external services that offer printing for really cheap.

There are three parts to print for the Tracker.


- Top Cover
- Chassis
- Bottom Cover

I recommend printing using a 3D resin printer, the press-fit parts and tolerances needed for this project might be difficult
with a traditional FDM printer. At-least in my experience.

### Printer Settings
I used two different resin colors for the chassis, the top and bottom cases are printed with white resin, and the middle
chassis is printed with yellow resin to which I added some resin dye to get a darker shade or orange-yellow.

Following are the settings that worked well for me for Elegoo Saturn 2 8K printer.

| Setting                   | Value     |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Layer Height              | 0.05mm    |
| Bottom Layer Count        | 5         |
| Exposure Time             | 4.500s    |
| Bottom Exposure Time      | 35s       |

I used the free version of Chitubox.

### 3rd party printing services
These are some 3D printing services that seems to have pretty good pricing, seems like a worthy try if you do not have
access to a resin printer. (not sponsored)
