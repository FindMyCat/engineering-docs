# Welcome

Welcome to the engineering section of <>{PROJECT_FULL_NAME}</>. The purpose of this documentation is two-fold:
first, it serves as a how-to guide for those interested in the DIY build process, and second, it aims to act as a
resource for anyone curious about IOT / asset tracking in general.

My exploration with this subject has taken me deep into the realms of IOT and asset tracking, and I'm excited to share these insights here.
