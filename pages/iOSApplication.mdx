# iOS Application

The FindMyCat iOS application is used to manage all your devices and track their realtime location etc.
Once you successfully build and install it on your device using the following steps, you will be able to add/edit FindMyCat
tracker devices and track their location.

<Steps>
    ### Download `FindMyCat/ios-app` repository.
    Github Repository link: https://github.com/FindMyCat/ios-app

    ```shell copy
    git clone https://github.com/FindMyCat/ios-app.git
    ```

    ### Configure `Info.plist`
    Open `FindMyCat.xcodeproj` in Xcode and configure the following in `Info.plist`
    | Info.plist Key                       | Why                                                                                      |
    | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `HologramAPIKey`                     | Your Hologram API key, found in Hologram.io dashboard (settings page)                            |
    | `HologramOrgId`                      | Your Hologram Org Id                                                                             |
    | `MBXAccessToken`                     | Your Mapbox Public token                                                                         |
    | `FindMyCat-Cloud-Hostname`            | Your FindMyCat Cloud `hostname:port`.                                   |
    | `NSAppTransportSecurity/NSExceptionDomains` | Add FindMyCat-Cloud-Hostname to the `NSExceptionDomains`. Please see the note below on why this is needed |

    ### Build and Run.
    Click build in Xcode and you should be able to install in on your iPhone.
</Steps>

### Why HTTP and not HTTPS?
As of now, I haven't been able to successfully set up HTTPS on my AWS account, which is why there's a `TODO` ([#1](https://github.com/FindMyCat/ios-app/issues/1)) to eventually switch to HTTPS for the app.
This challenge likely stems from my limited experience with certificates and cybersecurity. To keep the project moving forward, I made the decision to use HTTP instead.

If you are proficient in SSL/Certs and willing to help with creating documentation for implementing HTTPS with AWS or self-hosting, please don't hesitate to reach out via the <a href={SLACK_INVITE_LINK} target="_blank"> <strong>Slack Channel</strong></a>.
Your expertise would be greatly appreciated in incorporating HTTPS effectively.
